  "description": "This schema defines a structured way to describe a visual scene for generative AI models. Providing detailed, well-organized prompts helps the AI understand your intent more accurately, leading to higher quality and more specific image outputs. Use this schema to guide your AI Studio prompt creation for optimal results. Each field contributes to a different aspect of the final image, from the overall concept to minute details.",
